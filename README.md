In order to enhance the efficiency of ambulance services and emergency medical responses in Algiers, Algeria,
our objective is to optimize ambulance routes, patient transfers, and overall emergency response times.
Specifically, our focus is on determining the most optimal route for patients requiring hospital or clinic visits within Algiers.
To achieve this, we utilized a detailed map of Algiers and gathered data on road intersections, which we represented as nodes in a graph.
This data was sourced from the Turbo Overpass website in the form of an OSM file, which we subsequently converted into a CSV format.
Additionally, we compiled information regarding all hospitals, clinics, and their respective emergency services across the city.
Subsequently, we applied various search strategies including A* and Uniform Cost Search (UCS), Bidirectional Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Hill Climbing.
This comprehensive analysis allowed us to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these strategies in optimizing emergency medical responses within Algiers.
